# Rot13.java

I have chosen to use java for the Rot-13 algorithm. I have also included a Main.java class, which has the user interface for the user to enter their desired string/text as well as their preferred rotation number. The main class also outputs the user's final string.

How to getting started and run the program:

After downloading and saving the files on your local machine, you need to unzip the folder and save the files in your desired workspace, then launch your preferred IDE.

Please follow this path to get to the main class: NothandoTshumaVeeqo/src/Main.java
To get to the Rot13 class: NothandoTshumaVeeqo/src/Rot13.java

After this, you need to run the main class, in order to get the program running.

Contributions were all made by myself, Nothando Tshuma.

Below is a link to the github repository with the same version of the algorithm:
